var synaptic = require("synaptic");

// write a function that creates a new NN for every user 
  // set up input layer, hidden layer, and output layer
    // input layer has 6 neurons, price, wine type, and 4 varietals
    // hidden layer has 3 neirons 
    // one output neuron
  // set up connections between them 
    // input is connected to hidden, hidden is connected to output

// function that trains NN - two inputs (NN, trainingData) 
  // make dummy data to test-train the NN
  // set up a trainer and pass in data 

// function that activates NN - (NN, inputs) 
  // return NN output

// test to see how NN performs - pass in various inputs and see what the output is
  // do a small amount of experimentation to maximize NN's performance 
    // adjust number of hidden layers and number of neurons
